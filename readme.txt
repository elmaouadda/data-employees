Project Overview
In this Power BI project, I have performed the following tasks:

Data Exploration: I have explored the employee data, including attributes such as employee ID, name, department, position, salary, performance ratings, and tenure.

Data Cleaning and Transformation: I have cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
 Additionally, I have transformed the data to create calculated columns and derived metrics to support analysis.

Data Modeling: I have created a robust data model in Power BI, establishing relationships between tables and defining appropriate hierarchies. 
This ensures a solid foundation for data analysis.

Visualizations and Dashboards: Using various visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables, I have built informative and interactive dashboards.
 These visualizations provide insights into employee demographics, performance metrics, salary distributions, and more.

Advanced Analytics: Leveraging Power BI's capabilities, I have implemented advanced analytics techniques such as forecasting, clustering, or sentiment analysis.
 This allows for deeper exploration of the employee data and identification of meaningful patterns.

Reporting and Insights: I have documented key findings and insights derived from the data analysis.
 This includes trends in employee performance, departmental comparisons, and recommendations for improving employee satisfaction and productivity.
